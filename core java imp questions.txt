1.What are data types and explain each data type? 
  A)  Data Types in Java
      Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. There are two types of data types in Java:

      Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
      Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.


2. what is class? what is object?


A class in Java is a **user-defined blueprint or prototype** from which objects are created. It represents the **set of properties or methods** that are common to all objects of one type. A class can contain **data members, methods, constructors, nested classes, and interfaces** . To declare a class in Java, you use the **class keyword** followed by the **class name** and optionally the **modifiers**, **superclass**, and **interfaces** .

An object in Java is an entity that has state and behavior12. It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible)1. For example, a chair, a bike, a pen, a car, etc. are physical objects, while a banking system, a calculator, a game, etc. are logical objects.

An object is created from a class, which is a template or blueprint for defining the properties and methods of an object2. A class can have fields, methods, constructors, blocks, nested classes and interfaces1.

To create an object of a class, you need to use the new keyword, which allocates memory for the object at runtime
